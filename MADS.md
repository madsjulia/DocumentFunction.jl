MADS (Model Analysis & Decision Support)
----------------------------------------

MADS is an integrated open-source high-performance computational (HPC) framework in [Julia](http://julialang.org).
MADS can execute a wide range of data- and model-based analyses:

* Sensitivity Analysis
* Parameter Estimation
* Model Inversion and Calibration
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Model Selection and Model Averaging
* Model Reduction and Surrogate Modeling
* Machine Learning and Blind Source Separation
* Decision Analysis and Support

MADS has been tested to perform HPC simulations on a wide-range multi-processor clusters and parallel environments (Moab, Slurm, etc.).
MADS utilizes adaptive rules and techniques which allows the analyses to be performed with a minimum user input.
The code provides a series of alternative algorithms to execute each type of data- and model-based analyses.
